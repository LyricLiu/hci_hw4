				<p>Fish! is an Android Phone Game for <span id="purple">Nervous Habbits Treatment</span>.</p>
				<p>Our project aims to identify the most common nervous habits that college students suffer from and propose a solution to help them prevent and avoid these habits. </p>
			</br>
				<h3>MY ROLE</h3>
				<div id="line"></div>
				<p>During the research phase, I took charge in creating the survey and doing ethnographic study. After that, I drew the storyboard of the scenario. I participated throughout the research reflection and helped come up with three possible ideas.Furthermore, I created one low-fidelity prototype and did the user test with my group members. At last, I made illustrations and animations to finalize our the high-fidelity game prototype based on our user feedback.</p>

			<h3>MOTIVATION</h3>
			<div id="line"></div>
			<p>A nervous habit is any repetitive movement or vocalization that a person may perform unconsciously when he or she is nervous or stressed. Nervous habits are repetitive behaviors or unwanted habit actions that can produce self-harming. These conditions trigger during stressful situations and most of the time are unconscious, making the person unable to control their execution. Nervous habits are highly correlated with anxiety, stress, and obsessive-compulsive disorder <label id="note">[1]</label>. One of the more prevalent traits is nail tic disorders; according to Singal, “they are examples of body-focused repetitive behaviors in which there is an irresistible urge or impulse to perform a certain behavior. The behavior is reinforced as it results in some degree of relief and pleasure <label id="note">[2]</label>”. In extreme cases, nervous habits can qualify as a disorder <label id="note">[3]</label>, but even in non-clinical cases these habits can be problematic for one’s health, career, and day-to-day interactions.

			<h3>TARGET USERS</h3>
			<div id="line"></div>
			<p>Nervous habits are very common, especially in adolescent and young adult populations. In a 1990 study of “purposeless habits” in college students, 63% of respondents reported biting their nails and not a single respondent reported having no such habit <label id="note">[4]</label>.</p>
			<p>We focus on students due to the prevalence of nervous habits in this population, and also to the frequent job-searching and interviewing that occurs. Nervous habits can be especially problematic in the workplace and in face-to-face job interviews <label id="note">[5]</label>; people are often unaware of their own habits (making them hard to avoid or prevent), but interviewers may see them as signs of distraction or insecurity. </p>

			<h2>RESEARCH</h2>
			<h3>SURVEY</h3>
			<div id="line"></div>
			<p>To learn more about our users, we created and disseminated a survey on nervous habits with a combination of closed-format and open-format questions. Our goal was to identify the most common nervous habits, when they are most likely to occur, how students feel about them, and suggestions for prevention and avoidance.  The survey allows to determine the perception of nervous habits in the user group to further select one in particular to be the focus or the project. Based on our survey result. We narrowed our nervous behavior to be nail bitting which is an annoying habbit that bothers students.</p>

			<h3>OBSERVATION</h3>
			<div id="line"></div>
			<img id="observation_img" src="./img/observation.png">
			<p id="observation_p"> We conducted four ethnographic observations with our target users. Observations were done to assess details in the nail biting process and to understand the work environment and the conditions around the user. During the observation, I kept track of the following things with specific time stamps: 1. The nail biting situation; 2. Nail biter’s awareness 3. Detailed behavior of nail biting; 4. Nail biter’s emotion. My notes include “His nail biting attempt was prevented when his companion talked to him suddenly”, “Most of the time he ended biting his nails for something else catches his attention”, etc.</p>

			<div id="affinity_p">
				<p>We used affinity diagram to organize our ideas and data that collected from our observation, survey and interview. The pink notes consist of:</p>
				<p>&bull;&nbsp;Effects of nervous habits.</p>
				<p>&bull;&nbsp;This is how I feel when I bite my nails.</p>
				<p>&bull;&nbsp;Visual proof of the habit.</p>
				<p>&bull;&nbsp;This is who I am around when I do or do not bite my nails.</p>
				<p>&bull;&nbsp;This is when and where I bite my nails (Public vs. Private).</p>

			<h3>STORYBOARD</h3>

			<img id="storyboard" src="./img/storyboard.png">
			<p>Student works at computer → student gets stressed out about a deadline or something similar → student stops working and bites nails → student returns to working (cyclical) </p>

			<h3>IMPLICATIONS</h3>
			<div id="line"></div>
			<br>
			<p>&bull;&nbsp;People use their laptop most of the times for studying and working in assignments. This means we can use the laptop as a target device for our solution.</p>
			<p>&bull;&nbsp;Some users do not consider that nail biting is a problem that drastically affect their lives, but even if they think that, most of them are willing to try something to reduce it. </p>
			<p>&bull;&nbsp;The process of awareness is very important. We detected that people in very social environments are less inclined to bite their nails, so they tend to do it when they feel privacy, even if they are in public environments.</p>
			<p>&bull;&nbsp;People have different habits and processes of nail-biting; understanding the physical actions and the affiliated emotions (gleaned from the survey and from observation) will help us best tailor a design to fit user needs. </p>
			<p>&bull;&nbsp;Social environment is also very important: students’ feelings, stress, and habits are affected by their friends and others around them. This social context can be both helpful and harmful, depending on the person and the situation. </p>
			<p>&bull;&nbsp;We speculate that nail biting can be a way to release stress and anxiety tension. In fact, many survey respondents felt this way, and were interested in addressing the underlying problem of stress rather than just the resulting nervous habit.</p>
			<p>&bull;&nbsp;Since some users do not notice the behavior, they don’t realize how frequently they bite their nails and also they are not aware of it every time de do. Since it is something that is not consciously done, it is even harder to quantify by the user.</p>

			<h2>LOW - FIDELITY PROTOTYPE</h2>
			<h3>PROTOTYPE #1</h3>
			<div id="line"></div>
			<p>Our first prototype is a wearable bracelet, with colors and vibrations. It will give quick and instantaneous feedback with vibration whenever the accelerometer and related sensors note that you are in the process of biting your nails. It will also have a band that changes color throughout the day as you bite your nails more, to alert you to how many times that day you have bitten your nails. This combination of Pavlov-esque alert and Fitbit-esque tallying will allow the user to gain awareness about their nail-biting in the moment and track their success in avoiding it as they go about their day. </p>
